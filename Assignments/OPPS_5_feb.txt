Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.
ans:
Object ? Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating
 Class ? A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.



Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.
ans:
Four pillar of OOPS are:-
1-Abstraction.
2-Encapsulation.
3-Inheritance.
4-Polymorphism.


Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.
ans:
class Songs:
    def __init__(self, arguments):
        self.argument=argument
        # function definition
As the above example explains, __init__ is a special python method that runs whenever a new object is created. These types of functions are used to initialize the attributes of that class, E.g., if the class is Person, then the attributes will be name, age, etc.


Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?
ans:
The self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. It works as a reference to the object. Python uses the self parameter to refer to instance attributes and methods of the class.


Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.
ans:
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
Types of Inheretence:-

1-  Multi-level Inheritance:
class class1 :
    def test_class1(self) : 
        print("this is my class1 " )
        
class class2(class1) : 
    def test_class2(self) : 
        print("this is my class2" )
        
class class3(class2) : 
    def test_class3(self) : 
        print("this is my class3 ")

2- Multiple inheritance:
class class1:
    def test_class1(self) : 
        print("this is my class 1" )
        
class class2 :
    def test_class2(self) : 
        print("this is my class 2")
        
class class3 (class1 , class2) : #here Class 3 is performing multiple inheritance
    pass

3- Hierarchical Inheritence:
class Parent:
    def func1(self):
        print("This function is in parent class.")
 
# Derived class1
 
 
class Child1(Parent):
    def func2(self):
        print("This function is in child 1.")
 
# Derivied class2
 
 
class Child2(Parent):
    def func3(self):
        print("This function is in child 2.")

4-Hybrid Inheritence:
class School:
    def func1(self):
        print("This function is in school.")
 
 
class Student1(School):
    def func2(self):
        print("This function is in student 1. ")
 
 
class Student2(School):
    def func3(self):
        print("This function is in student 2.")
 
 
class Student3(Student1, School):
    def func4(self):
        print("This function is in student 3.")
