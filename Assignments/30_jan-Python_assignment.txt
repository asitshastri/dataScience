5- Why and when to use loops in python give a detailed discription with example?
Loops are important in Python or in any other programming language as they help you to execute a block of code repeatedly. You will often come face to face with situations where you would need to use a piece of code over and over but you don't want to write the same line of code multiple times, use loops instead.


6-use nested while loop to print 3 different patterns
ans:
pattern1:
n=10 #n is length and width of triangle
for i in range(0, n): #loop to handle the rows 

    for j in range(0, i+1): #loop to handle the columns 

        print("* ",end="") #printing the stars 

    print("\r") #after each row line will end

pattern2:
num_rows = 5
row = 0 #row intialize
while(row < num_rows):
    row += 1 #Rows count increase
    s = num_rows - row #Spaces

    sc = 0 #Space counter intialize
    while(sc < s):
        print(" ", end='')
        sc += 1

    stars = 2*row-1 #Number of stars
    while(stars > 0):
        print("*", end='')
        stars -= 1

    print()

Pattern3:
n=7
for i in range(0,n):
    for j in range (0,i+1):
        print("* ",end="")


ans8:
n=10
while n!=0:
    print(n)
    n =n-1
