    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Object ? Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors â€“ wagging the tail, barking, eating\n",
    " Class ? A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.\n",

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Four pillar of OOPS are:-\n",
    "1-Abstraction.\n",
    "2-Encapsulation.\n",
    "3-Inheritance.\n",
    "4-Polymorphism.\n",

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",

    "    def __init__(self, arguments):\n",
    "        self.argument=argument\n",
    "        # function definition\n",
    "As the above example explains, __init__ is a special python method that runs whenever a new object is created. These types of functions are used to initialize the attributes of that class, E.g., if the class is Person, then the attributes will be name, age, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "The self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. It works as a reference to the object. Python uses the self parameter to refer to instance attributes and methods of the class.\n",

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.\n",
    "Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.\n",
    "Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n",
